# CastorOps

CastorOps is a Gemini-driven DevOps AI agent prototype for making GCP application design, deployment, and operations easier to understand.

The current repository contains the local demo-mode backend implementation used for the hackathon flow. It runs entirely in memory and exercises the core workflow without requiring live GCP credentials.

## Current Scope

Implemented:

- Project creation and phase transitions.
- Requirement follow-up question generation.
- Requirement, design, architecture, and security agent workflow orchestration.
- Approval gates for requirements, design, and architecture.
- Architecture proposal validation and editable node updates.
- Target FastAPI app package generation.
- Deterministic Cloud Build apply plan rendering.
- Local Cloud Build deployment simulation.
- Ops dashboard summary sections.
- Timeline events and SSE event encoding helpers.
- Dependency-free local demo HTTP server and static UI.
- Container runtime for Cloud Run.
- Cloud Build pipeline for testing, building, pushing, and deploying CastorOps.
- GitHub Actions CI for compile, unit tests, and secret pattern smoke checks.

Not implemented in this repository yet:

- Persistent Firestore / Cloud Storage adapters.
- Live Vertex AI / Gemini provider adapter.
- Live Cloud Build / Cloud Run architecture-apply adapter.
- Authentication for production usage. The hackathon demo uses a single demo identity.

## Design Document

The main design document is:

- [castor_ops_design_docs_v21.md](castor_ops_design_docs_v21.md)

The design document is the source of truth for the intended hackathon product scope, architecture, and later production direction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer.
- No third-party Python package is required for the current local demo and test suite.

## Local Validation

Run the unit tests:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Compile all Python modules:

```powershell
python -m compileall app tests scripts
```

Run the local end-to-end demo:

```powershell
python scripts\run_full_demo.py --idea "support desk app" --target-project-id demo-gcp-project
```

Run only the requirement workflow demo:

```powershell
python scripts\run_requirement_demo.py --idea "support desk app"
```

Serve the local browser demo:

```powershell
python scripts\serve_demo.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --target-project-id demo-gcp-project
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Run the same server in a container:

```powershell
docker build -t castorops:local .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -e PORT=8080 -e HOST=0.0.0.0 castorops:local
```

Deploy CastorOps itself through Cloud Build:

```powershell
.\scripts\deploy_self.ps1 -ProjectId "your-gcp-project" -Region "asia-northeast1" -Service "castorops" -TargetProjectId "demo-gcp-project"
```

The deployment command requires a configured `gcloud` CLI, an active billing account, and the required Google Cloud APIs enabled for the target project.

## Configuration And Secrets

The local demo does not require secrets.

For a Cloud Run demo deployment:

- `PORT` is provided by Cloud Run.
- `HOST` defaults to `0.0.0.0` in the container.
- `TARGET_PROJECT_ID` controls the target GCP project id shown in generated plans.

Do not commit `.env`, service account keys, API keys, OAuth secrets, or downloaded credentials. Use Cloud Run environment variables and Secret Manager for real credentials when live adapters are introduced.
